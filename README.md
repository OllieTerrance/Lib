Libraries
=========

This repository holds copies of all library files used by other repos.  A few of my other projects note that they require certain components manually placed in a `lib` folder - this can 
just be dropped in instead.


How to use
==========

For a project requiring a `lib` folder, just copy or symlink the one in this repo.
